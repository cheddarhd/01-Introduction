# 01-Introduction

My Code:

I have some experience with python from taking I-101 so this assigment was not too difficult. I added print commands with just ('') to create just some space between the answers. Overall excited to start using things like github and stackoverflow as I have never used anything like these websites before.



The grading criteria will be as follows:

* [1 point] Assignment turned in on time
* [1] Repository contains an appropriate software license
* [2] Repository contains a descriptive README.md
* [1] Requires Python 3
* [1] No syntax errors
* [8] Accomplishes the objective of the assignment
* [2] No other runtime errors
* [2] Validates user input (if necessary)
* [2] Adds interesting features (beyond the scope of the assignment)
